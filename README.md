GitHub tutorial
Short overview of GitHub/What is Github?

    A SITE FOR COLLABORATION - not just code; 


    What you contribute to a GitHub project (repository) doesn't have to be perfect or a complete overhaul--you are creating incremental changes to make the project/product better. 


    URL structure: 

    http://www.github.com/USERNAMEORORGANIZATIONNAME/nameofrepository

explain what a repository is; a folder that is public, code is available, also store documents, can have subfolders in there; 

**Part 1**
Repositories:

    https://training.github.com/kit/modules/COLL-01_Exploring-a-repository.html


    "The GitHub repository is the container that holds everything related to your project.

    The code view is where you will find the files included in the repository. These files may contain the project code, documentation, and other important files. We also call this view the root of the project. Any changes to these files will be tracked via Git version control.

    The README.md is a special file that we recommend all repositories contain. GitHub looks for this file and helpfully displays it below the repository. The README should explain the project and point readers to helpful information within the project. " --GitHub training class materials. 



**Part 2**
ISSUES:
https://training.github.com/kit/modules/COLL-02_Using-issues.html

    Issues  are used to track bugs and feature requests. Issues can be assigned to  specific team members and are designed to encourage discussion and  collaboration. --GitHub training materials


    Also great place for discussion--Can show our own issues e.g. opencleveland/opencleveland.github.io#16

    YES! 

    we could also show this - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlrJVSJRUN4  YES! 



**Part 3** 
Fork: 

    A fork is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original. Forks remain attached to the original, allowing you to submit a pull request to the original's author to update with your changes. You can also keep your fork up to date by pulling in updates from the original. --GitHub glossary https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/


Pull Request: 

    A Pull Request represents a change, such as adding, modifying, or deleting files, which the author would like to make to the repository. Pull Requests are used to resolve Issues. Go ahead and click around in the class repository now to familiarize yourself with its contents. --GitHub training materials 


Merge: 

    Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another. This often happens as a Pull Request (which can be thought of as a request to merge), or via the command line. A merge can be done automatically via a Pull Request via the GitHub.com web interface if there are no conflicting changes, or can always be done via the command line. --GitHub glossary

https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ Could we walk them through this as the exercise? 




social features 
https://training.github.com/kit/modules/COLL-03_Watching-notifications-stars-explore.html


There are two exercises we could do: creating your own repository to do the hello world exercise AND contributing to an existing one (tacofancy?)

GISTS: 

    need a place to put a code sample, or some text and it doesn't belong to a particular project ? 

    make a gist!
